## Overview
The goal of this challenge is to design a QR component.

## My process
First I began analyzing the design and the blocks that I needed. I selected three blocks, a main block that contain the next two blocks: One for the image, and one for the text. 

```html
<main class="contenedor">
    <div class="cont__img">
      <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
    </div> 


    <div class="cont__text">
      <h2 class="cont__text1">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>

      <p class="cont__text2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </main>

```
The next step was to give it the style. In the mobile version it was going to be the same block but with the background bigger, so I don't used media queries, just the same code but with different margin.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

---

## What I learned
I did strengthen my knowledge about mobile-first workflow. For me, now it's more easy make the mobile version first and then adapt it to the desktop. 
I became with this first challenge more confident about what can I do coding, more confident about my coding skills. 

---

## Continued development

I want to learn more about flexbox and grid, and responsive design. I need to be an expert and learn how to do attractive designs like this one.
